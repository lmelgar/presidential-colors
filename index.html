      <h3>Executive Colors</h3>
      <h4>A visual exploration of the colors of U.S. presidental portraits</h4>

    <p class="paragraphs">When I saw in person the vivid colors of <a href="https://npg.si.edu/learn/classroom-resource/barack-obama">Barack Obama's</a> presidential portrait at the <a href="https://npg.si.edu">National Portrait Gallery</a>, a question popped in my mind: Has the presidential portrait tradition changed over the years when it comes to its color palette? I set out to explore this in all the presidential portraits.</p>

    <p class="paragraphs">What you see above are the most prevalent colors in the portraits. This project is just <strong>an experiment</strong>, if you want to know more about how I did it, you can read about it <a href="#methodology">here</a>.</p>

    <div id="graph-3">
      <h5>43 presidents, 16 Colors</h5>
      <p class="graph-intro">Explore how the colors used in presidential portraits have evolved. Or look for what colors portrait your favorite president.</p>

    <p class="paragraphs" id="methodology"><strong>ABOUT THE DATA:</strong> The data used for this project was created using the progamming language R and the package PaletteR. This package uses statistical analysis to extract the most prominent colors from an image (and, of course, it isn't perfect). You can read more about it <a href="http://www.andreacirillo.com/2018/05/08/how-to-use-paletter-to-automagically-build-palettes-from-pictures/">here.</a> I decided to extract 16 colors from each portrait. That number is arbitrary.</p>

    <p class="paragraphs">The visualizations were made with JavaScript. You can find the R and JavaScript code <a href="https://github.com/lmelgar/presidential-colors">here.</a></p>

    <p class="paragraphs">The goal of this project was just to play with this two tools, to have some fun.</p>

    <p class="paragraphs">The portrait images came mostly from <a href="https://www.whitehousehistory.org/galleries/presidential-portraits">The White House Historical Association</a> and President Barack Obama's <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/photos-and-video/photogallery/official-portraits-us-presidents">White House website</a>.</p>

    <p class="paragraphs">If you want to learn more about the portraits of the U.S. presidents (and the first ladies), you should listen to <a href="https://www.whitehousehistory.org/1600-sessions/presidential-portraits">this podcast.</a> And if you are in Washington, D.C., you should visit the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
