    <p class="paragraphs">When I saw in person the vivid colors of <a href="https://npg.si.edu/learn/classroom-resource/barack-obama">Barack Obama's</a> presidential portrait at the <a href="https://npg.si.edu">National Portrait Gallery</a>, a question popped in my mind: Has the presidential portrait tradition changed over the years when it comes to its color palette? I set out to explore this in all the presidential portraits.</p>

    <p class="paragraphs">What you see above are the most prevalent colors in each portrait. This project is just an experiment. If you want to know more about how I did it, you can read about it <a href="#methodology">here</a>.</p>

    <div id="graph-3">
      <h5>43 presidents, 16 Colors</h5>
      <p class="graph-intro">Explore how the colors used in presidential portraits have evolved. Or look for what colors portrait your favorite president.</p>

    <p class="paragraphs" id="methodology">The data used for this project was created using the library PaletteR. This package helps to extract the most prominent colors from an image. You can read more about it <a href="http://www.andreacirillo.com/2018/05/08/how-to-use-paletter-to-automagically-build-palettes-from-pictures/">here</a>. I decided to extract 16 colors from each portrait. That number is arbitrary. The visualizations were made with Javascript. You can find the code here.</p>

    <p class="paragraphs">The portrait images came from <a href="https://www.whitehousehistory.org/galleries/presidential-portraits">The White House Historical Association</a> and President Barack Obama's <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/photos-and-video/photogallery/official-portraits-us-presidents">White House website</a>.</p>
